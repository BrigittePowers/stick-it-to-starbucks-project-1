## User Story

> AS A college-age student with limited transportation
I WANT to be able to narrow down my search to nearby
locations and recieve directions to my chosen Starbucks alternative
SO THAT I can view a list of options that are feasible for me to access.

> AS A frugal shopper with a careful budget
I WANT to be able to see price data of my various coffee shop options
and a few common menu items 
SO THAT I can factor finances into my decision about which shop
to try out and make an informed choice.

> AS A busy coffee enthusiast on the go
I WANT to be able to view and utilize the application on my 
mobile device
SO THAT I can check for a coffee shop alternative while I'm 
already out and about
