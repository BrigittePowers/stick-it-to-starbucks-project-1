# Stick it to Starbucks
## _When local business fits, you S.I.T.S._


The goal of this project is to develop an application that
will provide information about nearby local coffee shops as an
alternative to _another_ Starbucks run.


## Elevator Pitch

The goal of this project was to develop an application that will provide 
results about nearby local coffee shops in a given radius from the user’s 
location. Upon result selection, app will provide navigational assistance 
to that location as an alternative to Starbucks in an effort to support 
the local community.


## Motivation for Development
The Gen Z and Millennial demographic group make up the majority
of the world's coffee drinkers.

> QUALITY - For this group, quality trumps quantity
> 
> TRAVEL - More likely to drink coffee outside the home
> 
> INNOVATION - Willing to spend more $$$ on a complex/innovative drink
> 
> DESTINATION - Willing to travel to find quaint destination
> 
> EXPERIENCE - Seeks genuine community-oriented experience
> 
> SUPPORT LOCAL - Prefers to support local, small business vs chain
> 
> SUSTAINABILITY - Identify with values geared towards sustainable practices 
> 
> AUTHENTICITY - Seek genuine products/services that share in creating genuine experiences
> 


## User Story

> AS A coffee drinker, I WANT an app to find local coffee shops within a 
specific radius from my location SO THAT I can select and navigate to them.

> AS A coffee drinker, I WANT this app to filter out chain coffee locations 
(such as Starbucks) SO THAT only local, small shops are displayed for me to 
discover and support locally.

> AS A coffee drinker, I WANT my recent search to be saved upon refresh 
SO THAT I can easily navigate back to those results or clear if I’d 
like to search in a different area.

> AS A coffee drinker, I WANT the app to display the top 3 results with 
the shop name, distance, travel time, and website SO THAT I can select 
and navigate to the location of my choice.
